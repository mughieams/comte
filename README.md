### Enabling Comments
Comments are disabled by default. To enable them, look for the following line in `_config.yml` and change `jekyll-comte` to your site's Disqus id.

```yml
disqus: jekyll-comte
```

Next, add `comments: true` to the YAML front matter of the posts which you would like to enable comments for.
