One day, I decided to build a website to showcase mine works and make web-portofilio from that. I was looking for a simple website but not too simple and also feels modern in a minimal way. With that reason brought me to the [jihyeleee](http://jihyeleee.com/) website which is a customized [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme called [Tale](https://rubygems.org/gems/tale/) by [Chester How](https://github.com/chesterhow/).

I felt thankful to Chester How and Jihye Lee who put your code theme on GitHub, I can trace through the code, read documentation from Jihye "with extra effort cause used korean language with ÌïúÍ∏Ä (hangul) üòÇ" and finally compare these themes. I decided to working on my own theme with merge those theme and customize advanced by my own.
